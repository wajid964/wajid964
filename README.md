I am 20 years old and currently in my fourth year, with an expected graduation in 2024. I am pursuing a career in Computer Engineering at The Islamia University of Bahawalpur. I was born and raised in Multan, Pakistan. 
My motivation for choosing Computer Engineering stems from my passion for programming and the realization that with knowledge, I can make a computer perform almost any task I desire. I have a strong interest in the fields of Machine Learning and Data Science, and I am actively acquiring the skills required to excel in these areas. 
I firmly believe that passion and determination can lead to success.
